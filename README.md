## 💻 Project


This project was developed to serve as a REST API, consolidating application rules and validations.<br>
The application was created with the objective of creating students and teachers, and with these users create their respective rooms and periods.
In this project we used a very famous concept in software architecture called MVC, with which the project is divided into 3 layers of responsibilities, which can (or not) be extended for a better use.<br>
